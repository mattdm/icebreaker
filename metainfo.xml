      IceBreaker is an action-puzzle game in which you must capture penguins from an Antarctic iceberg so they can be shipped to Finland, where they are essential to a secret plot for world domination. To earn the highest Geek Cred, trap them in the smallest space in the shortest time while losing the fewest lives.

      IceBreaker was inspired by (but is far from an exact clone of) Jezzball by Dima Pavlovsky.
